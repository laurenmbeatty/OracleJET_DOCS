<!-- ************************ IMPORTANT INFORMATION ************************************
     This file and Quick Start project are provided as an example of how to configure a JET application.
     It contains the Oracle JET framework and a default requireJS configuration file to show how JET can be setup
     in a common application. This project template can be used in conjunction with demo code from the JET website 
     to test JET component behavior and interactions.

     Any CSS styling with the prefix "demo-" is for demonstration only and is not provided as part of the JET framework.

     The Header and Footer sections are provided for demonstration only. They are not part of the JET framework. 
     Best practice patterns are provided as part of the JET website under the Samples section.

     Aria Landmark role attributes are added to the different sections of the application for accessibility compliance.
     If you change the type of content for a specific section from what is defined, you should also change the 
     role value for that section to represent the appropriate content type.
